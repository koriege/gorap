      -a      Specify a column weight file name to assign individual weights to each column of 
              the alignment. Those weights must be integers separated by any type and number 
              of whitespaces whithin a separate file, see file "example_weights" for an example.

      -A      Specify one of the secondary structure substitution models implemented in RAxML.
              The same nomenclature as in the PHASE manual is used, available models: 
              S6A, S6B, S6C, S6D, S6E, S7A, S7B, S7C, S7D, S7E, S7F, S16, S16A, S16B

              DEFAULT: 16-state GTR model (S16)

      -b      Specify an integer number (random seed) and turn on bootstrapping

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -B      specify a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that will be used as cutoff threshold 
              for the MR-based bootstopping criteria. The recommended setting is 0.03.

              DEFAULT: 0.03 (recommended empirically determined setting)

      -c      Specify number of distinct rate catgories for RAxML when modelOfEvolution
              is set to GTRCAT or GTRMIX
              Individual per-site rates are categorized into numberOfCategories rate 
              categories to accelerate computations.

              Robinson-Foulds distance between the trees obtained from two consecutive lazy SPR cycles
              is smaller or equal to 1%. Usage recommended for very large datasets in terms of taxa.
              On trees with more than 500 taxa this will yield execution time improvements of approximately 50%
              While yielding only slightly worse trees.

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -e      set model optimization precision in log likelihood units for final
              optimization of tree topology under MIX/MIXI or GAMMA/GAMMAI

              DEFAULT: 0.1   for models not using proportion of invariant sites estimate
                       0.001 for models using proportion of invariant sites estimate

      -E      specify an exclude file name, that contains a specification of alignment positions you wish to exclude.
              Format is similar to Nexus, the file shall contain entries like "100-200 300-400", to exclude a
              single column write, e.g., "100-100", if you use a mixed model, an appropriatly adapted model file
              will be written.

      -F      enable ML tree searches under CAT model for very large trees without switching to 
              GAMMA in the end (saves memory).
              This option can also be used with the GAMMA models in order to avoid the thorough optimization 
              of the best-scoring ML tree in the end.

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -g      specify the file name of a multifurcating constraint tree
              this tree does not need to be comprehensive, i.e. must not contain all taxa

      -G      enable the ML-based evolutionary placement algorithm heuristics
              by specifiyng a threshold value (fraction of insertion branches to be evaluated
              using slow insertions under ML).

      -h      Display this help message.

      -i      Initial rearrangement setting for the subsequent application of topological 
              changes phase

      -I      a posteriori bootstopping analysis. Use:
             "-I autoFC" for the frequency-based criterion
             "-I autoMR" for the majority-rule consensus tree criterion
             "-I autoMRE" for the extended majority-rule consensus tree criterion
             "-I autoMRE_IGN" for metrics similar to MRE, but include bipartitions under the threshold whether they are compatible
                              or not. This emulates MRE but is faster to compute.
              You also need to pass a tree file containg several bootstrap replicates via "-z" 

      -j      Specifies that intermediate tree files shall be written to file during the standard ML and BS tree searches.

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -J      Compute majority rule consensus tree with "-J MR" or extended majority rule consensus tree with "-J MRE"
              or strict consensus tree with "-J STRICT".
              Options "-J STRICT_DROP" and "-J MR_DROP" will execute an algorithm that identifies dropsets which contain
              rogue taxa as proposed by Pattengale et al. in the paper "Uncovering hidden phylogenetic consensus".
              You will also need to provide a tree file containing several UNROOTED trees via "-z"

      -k      Specifies that bootstrapped trees should be printed with branch lengths.
              The bootstraps will run a bit longer, because model parameters will be optimized
              at the end of each run under GAMMA or GAMMA+P-Invar respectively.

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -K      Specify one of the multi-state substitution models (max 32 states) implemented in RAxML.
              Available models are: ORDERED, MK, GTR

              This will only work for DNA and/or PROTEIN data and only with the SSE3 or AVX-vextorized version of the code.

      -v      Display version information

      -V      Disable rate heterogeneity among sites model and use one without rate heterogeneity instead.
              Only works if you specify the CAT model of rate heterogeneity.

              DEFAULT: use rate heterogeneity

      -w      FULL (!) path to the directory into which RAxML shall write its output files

              DEFAULT: current directory

      -W      Sliding window size for leave-one-out site-specific placement bias algorithm
              only effective when used in combination with "-f S" 

              DEFAULT: 100 sites

      -x      Specify an integer number (random seed) and turn on rapid bootstrapping
              CAUTION: unlike in version 7.0.4 RAxML will conduct rapid BS replicates under 
              the model of rate heterogeneity you specified via "-m" and not by default under CAT

      -X      EXPERIMENTAL OPTION: This option will do a per-site estimate of protein substitution models
              by looping over all given, fixed models LG, WAG, JTT, etc and using their respective base frequencies to independently
              assign a prot subst. model to each site via ML optimization
              At present this option only works with the GTR+GAMMA model, unpartitioned datasets, and in the sequential
              version only.

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -y      If you want to only compute a parsimony starting tree with RAxML specify "-y",
              the program will exit after computation of the starting tree

              DEFAULT: OFF

      -Y      Pass a quartet grouping file name defining four groups from which to draw quartets
              The file input format must contain 4 groups in the following form:
              (Chicken, Human, Loach), (Cow, Carp), (Mouse, Rat, Seal), (Whale, Frog);
              Only works in combination with -f q !

      -z      Specify the file name of a file containing multiple trees e.g. from a bootstrap
              that shall be used to draw bipartition values onto a tree provided with "-t",
              It can also be used to compute per site log likelihoods in combination with "-f g"
              and to read a bunch of trees for a couple of other options ("-f h", "-f m", "-f n").

      -#|-N   Specify the number of alternative runs on distinct starting trees
              In combination with the "-b" option, this will invoke a multiple boostrap analysis
              Note that "-N" has been added as an alternative since "-#" sometimes caused problems
              with certain MPI job submission systems, since "-#" is often used to start comments.
              If you want to use the bootstopping criteria specify "-# autoMR" or "-# autoMRE" or "-# autoMRE_IGN"
              for the majority-rule tree based criteria (see -I option) or "-# autoFC" for the frequency-based criterion.
              Bootstopping will only work in combination with "-x" or "-b"

              DEFAULT: 1 single analysis





v0.000 != v7.017b (2013/01/12)

There is a problem in the configuration of your shell.
Check the MAFFT_BINARIES environmental variable by
$ echo $MAFFT_BINARIES

This variable must be *unset*, unless you have installed MAFFT
with a special configuration.  To unset this variable, type
$ unset MAFFT_BINARIES
or
% unsetenv MAFFT_BINARIES
Then retry
$ mafft input > output

To keep this change permanently, edit setting files
(.bash_profile, .profile, .cshrc, etc) in your home directory
to delete the MAFFT_BINARIES line.
On MacOSX, also edit or remove the .MacOSX/environment.plist file
and then re-login (MacOSX 10.6) or reboot (MacOSX 10.7).

Please send a problem report to kazutaka.katoh@aist.go.jp,
if this problem remains.

Usage: cmsearch [options] <cmfile> <seqdb>

Basic options:
  -h        : show brief help on version and usage
  -g        : configure CM for glocal alignment [default: local]
  -Z <x>    : set search space size in *Mb* to <x> for E-value calculations  (x>0)
  --devhelp : show list of otherwise hidden developer/expert options

Options directing output:
  -o <f>       : direct output to file <f>, not stdout
  -A <f>       : save multiple alignment of all significant hits to file <s>
  --tblout <f> : save parseable table of hits to file <s>
  --acc        : prefer accessions over names in output
  --noali      : don't output alignments, so output is smaller

  --max      : turn all heuristic filters off (slow)
  --nohmm    : skip all HMM filter stages, use only CM (slow)
  --mid      : skip first two HMM filter stages (SSV & Vit)
  --default  : default: run search space size-dependent pipeline  [default]
  --rfam     : set heuristic filters at Rfam-level (fast)

  --acyk        : align hits with CYK, not optimal accuracy
  --wcx <x>     : set W (expected max hit len) as <x> * cm->clen (model len)
  --toponly     : only search the top strand
  --bottomonly  : only search the bottom strand

Running tic to install /home/koriege/programs/gorap/samtools-0.1.19/share/terminfo ...

	You may see messages regarding extended capabilities, e.g., AX.
	These are extended terminal capabilities which are compiled
	using
		tic -x
	If you have ncurses 4.2 applications, you should read the INSTALL
	document, and install the terminfo without the -x option.
